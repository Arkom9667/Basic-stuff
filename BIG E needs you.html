<h2> What to expect for parents? </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> You will be asked for consent to experiment on your child </li>
        <li> If you choose to accept the experimentation you are also signing the enlisting of your child in the Imperium's army </li>
        <li> Prepare yourself and your child mentally </li>
        <li> Your child may not be recognizable after the experiments are complete </li>
        <li> You will be compensated completely from the Emperor's pockets </li>
    </ol>
