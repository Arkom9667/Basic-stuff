<h1> This will be my death (probably) </h1>

<p> I have to do this to learn and remember shit so I can<br />
go back to it when I forget </p>
<hr />
<p> The world around us is fucked up isn't it?<br />
The world can be better and beautiful if you have enough<br />
strength to perceive it as such.<br />
The day will come when your parents will die,<br />
The day will come when you'll have hit your lowest,<br />
The day will come when you'll lose sleep over things like these<br />
But remember, it's always the darkest before the Sun rises. </p>
